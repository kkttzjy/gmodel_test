# gmodel_test
The R codes with simulation experiments and real data analysis examples for the two-sample test with g-modeling: two p-value estimation approaches are include -- simple bootstrap (KS) and accelerated bootstrap (ASY). 

## Simulation
The "ZIF simulation" file shows an example code of the similation for the zero-inflated Poisson case.
