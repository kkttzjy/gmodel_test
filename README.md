# gmodel_test
The R codes with simulation experiments and real data analysis examples for the two-sample test with g-modeling: two p-value estimation approaches are include -- simple bootstrap (KS) and accelerated bootstrap (ASY). 

## Simulation
The "ZIF simulation" file shows an example code of the similation for the zero-inflated Poisson case.

## Real data analysis: scRNA-seq data set
The "real data ASY.R" and "real data KS.R" are the example code of our two-sample test with two p-value estimation procedures for the single-ccell RNA-seq data set.

## Real data-based simulation
The "null case.R", "alternative case 1.R" and "alternative case 2.R" are the example codes for the binomail simulation based on the surgical real data set.
